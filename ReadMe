Personal Project, using arduino wifi and Android studio to create an app to keep track of in-game and potentially all time scores in a game of Warhammer 40K

The arduino code sets up an api layer and controls an lcd screen to display and update team names and score values while the Android studio gives you a mobile way of updating the scores without calling an api in the browser
